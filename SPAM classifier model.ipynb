    "# SPAM classifier model\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to train model which will *classify emails to SPAM and HAM*.\n",
    "We will use sample emails available here: `https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/`.\n",
    "Emails there as classified to spam and ham and compressed to `tar.bz` format. \n",
    "## The project is splitted into the following steps:\n",
    "1) download emails\n",
    "2) unpack emails to subfolders\n",
    "3) as the email has different extension convert them to `.txt` files and change their name appoprietly\n",
    "4) split set of emails into `training` and `test` set\n",
    "5) rename files in both folders\n",
    "6) check emails structure and design a transformation that convert an email into a vector of keywords\n",
    "7) before we use `scikit-learn` models, we design our own model\n",
    "8) reading all training emails create `spam` and `ham` vectors with unique keywords (then convert them to `dict` and save to a `.json` file)\n",
    "9) design an abstrac class (in case you wanted to design more models enforcing the same methods in them)\n",
    "10) create own (fast!) model: idea is simple: read list of words for a test email, convert to set and determine how many words are shared with `spam` set and `ham` set (normalized by sum of total length for both: `spam` and `ham`). Whichever set cardinality is higher, an email get its label (so if an email shares 20 words with SPAM and 15 with HAM, an email is classified as SPAM and get label 1). Based on the file name we retrive an information whether an email is well classified.\n",
    "11) In the model we use the following notation:\n",
    "    - `TP` - True Positve, if email was SPAM and its file label is the same\n",
    "    - `TN` - True Negative, if email was HAM and its file label is the same\n",
    "    - `FP` - False Positive, if email was classified as SPAM, but its file label was HAM\n",
    "    - `FN` - False Negative, if email was classified as HAM, but its file label was actually a SPAM\n",
    "12) we use *Mean Square Error* to measure how this model is good in a comparison to other `scikit-learn` models\n",
    "13) to use inbuild models one has to join labels from HAM and SPAM in a vector of unique columns and then matrix `X`, where columns are these words and rows are email must be created (for each email 0-1 vector is appened to `X`, 0 if word does not occur, 1 otherwise). Vector `Y` of zeros and ones is additionally created based on file name:  1 if email is spam, 0 otherwise.\n",
    "14) Models are imported and based on collected data we train them.\n",
    "15) Test set must also be created: a 0-1 matrix where rows are test emails and columns are words from the matrix `X`. Based on file names we can create validation vector of zeros and ones (0 if email is HAM, 1 otherwise).\n",
    "16) Based on training data models predict their values.\n",
    "17) Use MSE to check model validity."

    "## Remarks\n",
    "All mmodels (except SPAMModel) requirs a specific form of input data (X,Y). Their preparation is time, and memory comsuming. Among them are extremly good models, fast in training and prediction (*SGDClassifier*, *Logistic Regression* or *Naive Bayesian Model*), but also extremally slow: *SVC*. On the other hand *SPAMModel* is less requiring (time, memory, disc space), it gives a bit worse results than the best models, but *F1* is still acceptable.\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Depending on need, the choice of the best model may depend on `Precision`, `Recall`, or `F1 score`, additionaly if memory, time of implementation, collecting data for matrices X and Y (and additionally disc space) does not play a role then the best choices are `SGDClassifier`, `Naive Bayesian Model` or `Logistic Regression`. If however, one of these factor play a role `SPAMModel` also is a decent choice."
